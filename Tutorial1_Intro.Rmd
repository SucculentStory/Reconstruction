# R
- R is an Open Source (and freely available) environment for statistical computinga nd graphics
- Available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
- R is being actively developed with two major releases per year and dozens of releases of add on packages
- R can be extended with 'packages' that contain data, code, and documentation to add new functionality

# What Does it Look Like?
The R workspace in RStudio

# Why Use R
- R is a common tool among data experts at major universities
- No need to go through procurement, R can be installed in any environment on any machine and used with no licensing or agreements needed
- R source code is very readable to increase transparency of processes
- R code is easily borrowed from and shared with others
- R is incredibly flexible and can be adapted to specific local needs
- R is under incredibly active development, improving greatly, and supported wildly by both professional and academic developers

# R Advantages Continued
- R is platform agnostic--Linux, Mac, PC, server, desktop, etc.
- R can output results in a variety of formats
- R can build routines straight out of a database for common and universal reporting

R Can Compliment Other Tools
------------------------------------
- R plays nicely with data from Stata, SPSS, SAS and others
- R can check work, produce output, visualize results from other programs
- R can do bleeding edge analysis that aren't available in proprietary packages yet
- R is becoming more prevalent in undergraduate statistics courses

# Google Scholar Hits
R has recently passed Stata on Google Scholar hits and it is catching up to the two major players SPSS and SAS

<p align="center"><img src="img/googlescholar.png" height="500" width="700"></p>

# R Has an Active Web Presence
R is linked to from more and more sites 

<p align="center"><img src="img/sitelinks.png" height="500" width="700"></p>

# R Extensions
These links come from the explosion of add-on packages to R

<p align="center"><img src="img/addons.png" height="500" width="700"></p>

# R Has an Active Community 
Usage of the R listserv for help has really exploded recently

# R Vocabulary
- **packages** are add on features to R that include data, new functions and methods, and extended capabilities. Think of them as ``apps'' on your phone.
- **terminal** this is the main window of R where you enter commands
- **scripts** these are where you store commands to be run in the terminal later, like syntax in SPSS or .do files in Stata
- **functions** commands that do something to an object in R
- **dataframe** the main element for statistical purposes, an object with rows and columns that includes numbers, factors, and other data types
- **workspace** the working memory of R where all objects in the current session are stored
- **vector** the basic unit of data in R
- **symbols** anything not starting with a digit, can be used to name and store objects or to designate operations/functions
- **attributes** determine how functions act on objects

# Components of an R Setup
- **R** - obviously we need R. R works in the command line of any OS, but also comes with a basic GUI to operate on its own in Windows and Mac [download](http://cran.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio** - a much better way to work in R that allows editing of scripts, operation of R, viewing of the workspace, and R help all on one screen [download](http://rstudio.org/download/)
- **LaTeX** - for producing documents using R this is less necessary, but still useful. download [WIN](http://miktex.org/2.9/setup) [MAC](http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/)

**ADVANCED**

- **Dev Tools for R** - on Windows this is Rtools, on Linux and Mac it is installing the development mode of R download [WIN](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/R215x.html) [MAC](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/)
- **Git** - for version control, sharing code, and collaboration this is essential. It integrates well with RStudio. [download](http://git-scm.com/download)
- **pandoc** - for converting output into other formats for sharing with non-user**R**s! [download](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)
- **ImageMagick** - for creating more flexible graphics in R, including animations! [download](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) [alternate](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/

# Open Source Toolchain
- This really represents a completely open source toolchain to going from a data analysis idea, to a full fledged professional report
- These tools are free, updated regularly, and available on **any** platform **today**

# Some Notes about Maintaining R
- Adding packages onto R means you also have to update them with the `update.packages()` command
- Upgrading R, which is on a 6 month release cycle, is not straightforward
- We will walk through this a bit later, but remember that the flexibility in R means that users probably need to be self-supported

# R As A Calculator

```{r computing,echo=TRUE,results='markup'}
2+2 # add numbers
2*pi #multiply by a constant
7+runif(1,min=0,max=1) #add a random variable
4^4 # powers
sqrt(4^4) # functions
```

# Arithmetic Operators
- In addition to the obvious `+` `-` `=` `/` `*` and exponential `^`, there is also integer division `%/%` and remainder in integer division (known as modulo arithmetic) `%%`
```{r arithmetic}
2+2
2/2
2*2
2^2
2=2
23 %/% 2 
23 %% 2
```

# Other Key Symbols
- **<-** is the assignment operator, it declares something is something else
```{r}
foo<-3
foo
```
- **:** is the sequence operator
```{r}
1:10
# it increments by one
a<-100:120
a
```
- **This is handy**

# Using the Workspace
- To do more we need to learn how to manipulate the 'workspace'.
- This includes all the vectors, datasets, and functions stored in memory.
- All R objects are stored in the memory of the computer, limiting the available space for calculation to the size of the RAM on your machine.
- R makes organizing the workspace easy.
```{r}
x<-5 #store a variable with <-
x    #print the variable
z<-3 
ls() #list all variables
ls.str() #list and describe variables
rm(x)    # delete a variable
ls()
```

# R as a Language
- R is more than statistical software, it is a computer language
- Like any language it has rules (some poorly enforced), and conventions
- You will learn more as you go, but we'll go over a few to start

1. Case sensitivity matters
```{r}
a<-3
A<-4
print(c(a,A))
```
  * <font color="red">**a** &#8800; **A**</font> 
2. What happens if I type **print(a,A)**?
  * So what does **c** do?
```{r}
A<-c(3,4)
print(A)
```
  * **c** stands for concatenate and allows vectors to have multiple elements

# Language
- In language there are a number of ways to say the same thing
  *  <font color="green">The dog chased the cat.</font> 
  *  <font color ="blue">The cat was chased by the dog.</font>
  *  <font color ="red">By the dog, the cat was chased.</font>
- Some ways are more elegant than others, all convey the same message. 
```{r language}
a<-runif(100) # Generate 100 random numbers
b<-runif(100) # 100 more
c<-NULL       # Setup for loop (declare variables)
for(i in 1:100){  # Loop just like in Java or C
c[i]<-a[i]*b[i]
}
d<-a*b
identical(c,d) # Test equality
```
- Which is nicer?

# Reading Data In
- To read data in we have to tell R where it currently is on the filesystem by setting a working directory
- Then we have to tell it where to look for the dataset and what format that dataset is in
- CSV files are **simplest** for beginning use cases, but R is flexible
```{r}
# Set working directory to the tutorial director
# In RStudio can do this in "Tools" tab
setwd('~/r_tutorial_ed')
#Load some data
df<-read.csv('data/smalldata.csv')
# Note if we don't assign data to 'df'
# R just prints contents of table
```

# Objects
- Everything in R is an object--even functions
- Objects can be manipulated many ways
- A common example is applying the `summary' function to a variety of object types and seeing how it adapts
```{r}
summary(df[,28:31]) #summary look at df object
summary(df$readSS) #summary of a single column
```
-The **$** says to look for object **readSS** in object **df**

# Graphics too

```{r graphics1, results='fig',message=FALSE,dev='svg',fig.cap='Student Test Scores', fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
library(ggplot2) # Load graphics Package
qplot(readSS,mathSS,data=df,geom='point',alpha=I(0.3))+theme_bw()+opts(title='Test Score Relationship')+geom_smooth()
```

# Handling Data in R
- R handles data differently than many other statistical packages
- In R, all elements are objects
```{r}
length(unique(df$school))
length(unique(df$stuid))
```
- Results of function calls can be stored


# Special Operators
- The comparison operators <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != are used to compare values across vectors
```{r vectorcomp}
big<-c(9,12,15,25)
small<-c(9,3,4,2)
big>small
# Gives us a nice vector of logical values
big=small
# Oops--don't do this, reassigns big to small
print(big)
print(small)
```

# Special Operators II
- The best way to evaluate these objects is to use brackets
```{r brackets}
big<-c(9,12,15,25)
big[big==small]
# Returns values where the logical vector is true
```

# Special operators (III)
- The %in% operator determines whether each value in the left operand can be matched with one of the values in the right operand.
```{r specialoperand}
big<-c(9,12,15,25)
small<-c(9,12,15,25,9,1,3)
big[small%in%big]
```


# Special operators (IV)
- The logical operators || (or) and && (and) can be used to combine two logical values and produce another logical value as the result. The operator ! (not) negates a logical value. These operators allow complex conditions to be constructed.
```{r vectorlogic}
foo<-c('a',NA,4,9,8.7)
!is.na(foo) # Returns TRUE for non-NA
a<-is.numeric(foo)&&!is.na(foo)
a
```

# Special operators (V)
- The operators | and & are similar, but they combine two logical vectors. The comparison is performed element by element, so the result is also a logical vector.


# Data Modes in R
- R allows users to implement a number of different types of data
- The three basic data types are numeric data, character data, and logical data
-**numeric** includes valid numbers
```{r}
is.numeric(A)
print(A)
```
-**character** is known as strings in other software, any characters that have no numeric meaning
```{r}
b<-c('one','two','three')
print(b)
is.numeric(b)
print(b)
```
-**logical** is TRUE or FALSE values, useful for logical testing and programming
```{r}
c<-c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE)
is.numeric(c)
is.character(c)
is.logical(c) # Results in a logical value
```

# Factor
- A factor is a very special and sometimes frustrating data type in R

# Other Classes
- R classes can be specified for any special purpose


# Data Structures in R
- R has a number of basic data classes as well as arbitrary specialized object types for various purposes
- **vectors** are the basic data class in R and can be thought of as a single column of data (even a column of length 1)
- **matrices and arrays** are rows and columns of all the same mode data
- **dataframes** are rows and columns where the columns can represent different data types
- **lists** are arbitrary combinations of disparate object types in R

# Vectors 
- Everything is a vector in R, even single numbers
```{r vectors}
print(1)
# The 1 in braces means this element is a vector of length 1
print("This tutorial is awesome")
# This is a vector of length 1 consisting of a single "string of characters"
print(LETTERS) 
# This vector has 26 character elements
print(LETTERS[6])
# The sixth element of this vector has length 1
length(LETTERS[6])
# The length of that element is a number with length 1
```


# Matrices
- Matrices are combinations of vectors of the same length and data type

```{r matrix}
foo.mat<-matrix(c(rnorm(100),runif(100),runif(100),rpois(100,2)),ncol=4)
head(foo.mat)
cor(foo.mat)
```

# Dataframes
- Dataframes are combinations of vectors of the same length, but can be of different types
```{r dataframetypes}
str(df[,25:32])
```
- Blah blah

# Lists
- Lists are arbitrary collections of objects. 
- The objects do not have to be of the same type or same element

# Arrays
- Arrays are matrices of k dimensions

# Reproducible research

It is good to include the session info, e.g. this document is produced with **knitr** version `r packageVersion('knitr')`. Here is my session info:

```{r session-info}
print(sessionInfo(), locale=FALSE)
