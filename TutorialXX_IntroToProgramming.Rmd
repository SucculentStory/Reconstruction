# Introduction
In this session we will be learning a little about what computer programming is through the following topics
* History
* Basic Principles
* Syntax
* Algorithms
* 

# What is a programming language?
- "A language intended for use by a person to express a process by which a computer can solve a problem" ~ Hope and Jiping
- "A set of conventions for communicating an algorithm" ~ E. Horowitz
- "the art of programming is the art of organizing complexity" ~ Dijkstra 1972

# History (Ancient)
- 300 BC -- First algorithm developed by Euclid (greatest common divisor)
- 1820-1850 -- Charles Babbage invents mechanical computational devices
  * Difference Engine
  * Analytical Engine
  * Countess Ada Augusta of Lovelace, first computer programmer
  * Wrote the first algorithm to be processed by the Analytical Engine, to compute Bernoulli numbers
  * Only legitimate child of Lord Byron

# History (less ancient)
- 1940s -- ENIAC developed to calculate trajectories by US DOD
- 1950s -- First high level programming language invented
  * John Backus
  * Fortran (R is based on this)
  * For punch card machines, to compute on numerical data
- 1956-1962 -- John McCarthy deveops LISP
  * Developed for non-numerical computation
  * Has garbage collection for memory management
- 1974 -- C developed at Bell Labs
  * D. Ritchie
  * Still heavily used today (in R)
  
# History (recent)
- 1985 -- C++ developed at Bell Labs by Bjorne Stroustrup
  * type-safe object oriented language
  * compile-time type checking
- 1995 -- Java developed by J. Gosling at SUN
  * Widely used across the web today
  * Portability across platform through use of abstract machine that implements language 

# HistoRy
- R plays nicely with many of these languages including Python, C++, Java, and of course C and Fortran
- 


# Basic Principles
- A computer program (or software) is: 
  * A set of instructions which a computer can interpret to solve problems, make calculations, perform tasks
- A programming language is: 
  * A formal "language" that humans use to write programs that computers can understand
- An algorithm is: 
  * A precise set of instructions for solving a particular type of problem
  * Classic example is "Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich (PBJS) Algorithm"
  
# Programs and Algorithms
  - A computer program is the specific set of instructions that tells the hardward how to complete a particular algorithm
  - Different instructions can use different methods (mathematically equivalent) to reach the same end
  - 2+2 = 4
  - 2/1 + 2/1 = 4/1
  
# Algorithms
  - Conceptual and can be written in *psuedo code* (if this, then this)
  - Or as flow charts
  
# Models
- A model is an abstract (usually simplified) representation of something
  * Formulas that model physical processes
  * A line representing a trend in a data
  * Musical notation as a model of a song
- Computer programs interact with models to test scientific theories, processes, events, finance, games, etc.

# Desired Features
- Readable
  * Comments
  * Names
  * Syntax
- Simple to learn
  * A small number of concepts combine regularly without exceptions
- Portable
  * Standard across architectures
- Abstraction
  * Control and data structures that hide detail
- Efficient

# Compilation vs. Interpretation
- Compiled languages are translated into machine executable language
- Interpreted languages have programs translated and executed one step at a time by a "virtual machine"

# Syntax and Rules

# Formalization
- Syntax and grammar of computer program languages force us to specify what we want the computer to do very carefully
- Example: Calculate the mean reading score for a school
- Use words to explain how the computer should do this?

# Session Info

It is good to include the session info, e.g. this document is produced with **knitr** version `r packageVersion('knitr')`. Here is my session info:

```{r session-info}
print(sessionInfo(), locale=FALSE)
