# Materials
If you don't already, now might be a good time to install R and RStudio to get started. 

- [Download R](http://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/) 
- We'll also want to install a few basic packages. This can be done on the fly later, but a few include `ggplot2`;`knitr`;`plyr`


# Installing R on Windows

# Installation Tips
- Setting up R on Windows XP is straightforward. On Windows 7 or Vista you may need to run in administrator mode to install extensions.
- Standard R interface in Windows is pretty ugly, which is why we use RStudio!

# Housekeeping
- No food or drink in the Training Room (sorry!)
- Feel free to get up at any time as necessary
- If you get stuck, raise your hand and someone will stop over to look
- If no one is available, feel free to ask the instructor

# Have fun!

Let's get started!
