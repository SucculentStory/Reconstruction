# Welcome
Thanks for being here today!

# Outline
We hope to move through the following topics in the next couple of days.
- Introduction to R
- Getting Data In
- Handling Data in R
- Cleaning and Merging Data 
- Analytics
- Visualizations
- Getting Results Out
- Writing Functions, Sharing Code, Collaborating

# Materials
If you don't already, now might be a good time to install R and RStudio to get started. 
- [Download R](http://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/) 
- We'll also want to install a few basic packages. This can be done on the fly later, but a few include `ggplot2`;`knitr`;`plyr`

# Installation Tips
- Setting up R on Windows XP is straightforward. On Windows 7 or Vista you may need to run in administrator mode to install extensions.
- Standard R interface in Windows is pretty ugly, which is why we use RStudio!
