# Overview
In this lesson we hope to learn:
- Coding Style
- Git, GitHub, and add-on packages
- Write a `for' loop
- Write a basic function
- Mixed effect models
- Data mining with R

# Basic Principles
- Good professional data analysis is computer programming
- An analysis project is computer code
- Computer code has bugs and to fight bugs the code has to be readable
- 

# Coding Style
- An important part of making work reproducible is making your code readable and understandable
- Much of this involves looking into where to break lines and how to simplify expressions without making them obscure
- You can also take some cues about how to make your code consistent and clean


# Git and GitHub
- Working alone or in a group, `git` and GitHub can help
