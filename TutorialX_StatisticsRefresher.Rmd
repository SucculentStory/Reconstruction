# Introduction
We will review the following statistical concepts here through the lens of R:

- Statistical distributions
- Attributes of distributions
- Samples
- Standard deviations and standard errors
- Statistical models
- Univariate Regression
- Multivariate Regression
- Causality

# Describing Data
- At it's most basic level, statistics is about summarizing and understanding data
- Data are themselves abstractions of real world concepts we care about
- 


# Spread of the Data
- Data spread describes how scattered a data set is
- One type of data, categorical data, describes groups

```{r barplot}
qplot(factor(cyl),data=mtcars)+labs(x='cylinder',title='Car models by Cylinder Count')
```

- What can we learn here?

# Let's try another
- What can we learn from this chart type about the data?

```{r diamondplot}
data(diamonds)
qplot(factor(cut),data=diamonds)+labs(x='Cut',title='Diamonds by Cut Quality')
```

- What else might we want to learn?

# How about?

```{r diamondplot2}
qplot(factor(color),data=diamonds)+labs(x='Color',title='Diamonds by Color and Clarity')+
  facet_wrap(~clarity,nrow=2)
```

# Still more
- With diamonds we immediately want to look at price

```{r diamondplot3}
qplot(carat,price,data=diamonds,color=color)+geom_smooth(aes(group=1))
```
- What do you see?
- Outliers?
- Data modes?
- Clusters?

# Graphical Depictions of Data
- These are ways to show data with graphics
- Graphical displays are driven by the concept of dimensions
- One dimension--a single category
- Two dimensions--two categories

# Levels of Measurement
- Any given dimension may be measured at different [levels of measure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)
- Nominal: unordered categories of data
- Ordinal: ordered categories of data, relative size and degree of difference between categories is unknown
- Interval: ordered categories of data, fixed width, like discrete temperature scales
- Continuous (ratio): a measurement scale in a continuous space with a meaningful zero--physical measurements
- Derived by Stanley Smith Stevens in the 1940s and 50s

# Quiz 1
- Car color is what level of measurement?
- 

# Levels of measurement matter
- How you depict the data
- What you can calculate using the data


# Describing Data with Numbers
- What types of measures can we use to describe different levels of measurement?

Level of Meas.  | Stats
------------- | -------------
Nominal       | mode, Chi-squared
Ordinal       | median, percentile, (plus above)
Interval      | mean, standard deviation, correlation, ANOVA, plus above
Continuous    | geometric mean, harmonic mean, coefficient of variation, logarithms, plus above

# Let's talk about these statistics
- **STATISTIC:** a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g. its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items comprising the sample which are known together as a set of data. (Wikipedia)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic]
- These statistics can measure a number of features of a dataset, but we tend to think of them as measuring either **central tendency**, **spread**, or **association**
- We'll focus on these today.

# Measures of Central Tendency
- These are the three canonical measures of central tendency:
  * Mean
  * Median
  * Mode
- How are these different? What properties do they have? Why does this matter?

```{r centraltend}
qplot(hwy,data=mpg,geom='density')+geom_vline(xintercept=median(mpg$hwy),color=I("blue"),size=I(1.1))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(mpg$hwy),color=I("gold"),size=I(1.1))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=26,color=I("orange"),size=I(1.1))+
  geom_text(aes(x=median(mpg$hwy)+1.5,y=0.08,label="Median"),size=I(4.5))+
  geom_text(aes(x=mean(mpg$hwy)-1.5,y=0.06,label="Mean"),size=I(4.5))+
  geom_text(aes(x=26+1.5,y=0.05,label="Mode"),size=I(4.5))
```

```{r mpgtable}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(table(mpg$hwy)),type="html")
```

# Session Info

It is good to include the session info, e.g. this document is produced with **knitr** version `r packageVersion('knitr')`. Here is my session info:

```{r session-info}
print(sessionInfo(), locale=FALSE)
```
