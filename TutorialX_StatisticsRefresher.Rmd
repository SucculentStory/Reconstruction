# Introduction
We will review the following statistical concepts here through the lens of R:

- Probability and hypothesis testing
- Statistical distributions
- Attributes of distributions
- Samples
- Statistical models
- Univariate Regression
- Multivariate Regression
- Causality

# What is statistics?
- What do you think?
- From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics): 

> "Statistics is the study of the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.[1][2] It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection "

- Statistics gives us a way to quantify and express our uncertainty about the future or about the relationship of a sample to the population

### Key Concepts to Statistical Thinking

1. Probability
2. How to describe data
3. Drawing inferences from data
4. Causation

# Probability
- Probability rests on the concepts of randomness
- Randomness is an abstract principle that describes the behavior of events in the world
- Random phenomena have outcomes we cannot perfectly predict, but that have a regular distribution over many repetitions
- Probability describes the the proportion of times an event will occur in many repeated trials of observation
- The probability of the Packers winning the coin toss is 0.5
- Let's look at an example of coin tosses!

# Probability's uses
- For truly random independent events like coin flips, this is easy and uncertainty can become certainty
- But, what about events that depend on one another?

# But...
- What does it mean then when someone says "Kobe Bryant's 3 has a 40% chance of going in."
- Or "Mason Crosby has a 65% chance of making that field goal?"
- These aren't random events, are they?
- But we can model them as such with large enough sample size

# Interdependence and Independence
- Coins are obviously independent in their flipping, but other events are not
- 


# Hypothesis testing
- What does it mean when someone says something is statistically significant?
- "A significance is a formal procedure for comparing observed data with a hypothesis whose truth we want to assess."~ Moore and McCabe p. 436


# Describing Data
- At it's most basic level, statistics is about summarizing and understanding data
- Data are themselves abstractions of real world concepts we care about
- There are a number of useful ways to describe a set of data, some of which we have become familiar with so far


# Spread of the Data
- Data spread describes how scattered a data set is
- One type of data, categorical data, describes groups

```{r barplot}
qplot(factor(cyl),data=mtcars)+labs(x='cylinder',title='Car models by Cylinder Count')
```

- What can we learn here?

# Let's try another
- What can we learn from this chart type about the data?

```{r diamondplot}
data(diamonds)
qplot(factor(cut),data=diamonds)+labs(x='Cut',title='Diamonds by Cut Quality')
```

- What else might we want to learn?

# How about?

```{r diamondplot2}
qplot(factor(color),data=diamonds)+
  labs(x='Color',title='Diamonds by Color and Clarity')+
  facet_wrap(~clarity,nrow=2)
```

# Still more
- With diamonds we immediately want to look at price

```{r diamondplot3}
qplot(carat,price,data=diamonds,color=color)+geom_smooth(aes(group=1))
```
- What do you see?
- Outliers?
- Data modes?
- Clusters?

# Graphical Depictions of Data
- These are ways to show data with graphics
- Graphical displays are driven by the concept of dimensions
- One dimension--a single category
- Two dimensions--two categories

# Levels of Measurement
- Any given dimension may be measured at different [levels of measure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)
- Nominal: unordered categories of data
- Ordinal: ordered categories of data, relative size and degree of difference between categories is unknown
- Interval: ordered categories of data, fixed width, like discrete temperature scales
- Continuous (ratio): a measurement scale in a continuous space with a meaningful zero--physical measurements
- This classification was derived by Stanley Smith Stevens in the 1940s and 50s

# Quiz 1
- Color (of diamonds) is what level of measurement?
- Nominal
- Carats are what level of measurement?
- Continuous
- 


# Levels of measurement matter
- How you depict the data
- What you can calculate using the data


# Describing Data with Numbers
- What types of measures can we use to describe different levels of measurement?

Level of Meas.    Stats
----------------- ------------------------------------------
Nominal           mode, Chi-squared
Ordinal           median, percentile, (plus above)
Interval          mean, standard deviation, correlation, ANOVA, plus above
Continuous        geometric mean, harmonic mean, coefficient of variation, logarithms, plus above

# Let's talk about these statistics
- **STATISTIC:** a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g. its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items comprising the sample which are known together as a set of data. (Wikipedia)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic]
- These statistics can measure a number of features of a dataset, but we tend to think of them as measuring either **central tendency**, **spread**, or **association**
- We'll focus on these today.

# Measures of Central Tendency
- These are the three canonical measures of central tendency:
  * Mean
  * Median
  * Mode
- How are these different? What properties do they have? Why does this matter?

```{r centraltend}
qplot(hwy,data=mpg,geom='density')+geom_vline(xintercept=median(mpg$hwy),color=I("blue"),size=I(1.1))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(mpg$hwy),color=I("gold"),size=I(1.1))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=26,color=I("orange"),size=I(1.1))+
  geom_text(aes(x=median(mpg$hwy)+1.5,y=0.08,label="Median"),size=I(4.5))+
  geom_text(aes(x=mean(mpg$hwy)-1.5,y=0.06,label="Mean"),size=I(4.5))+
  geom_text(aes(x=26+1.5,y=0.05,label="Mode"),size=I(4.5))
```

```{r mpgtable,results='asis'}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(table(mpg$hwy)),type="html")
```

# The Mean
- Commonly thought of as the average
- Add up all the values, divide by the number of observations
- 2 + 6 + 3 + 9 + 1 = 21 
- Divide by 5 
- 4.2
- The mean is sensitive to the number of observations and the spread of the data

# The Median
- This is a measure of the value the middle observation takes
- Order the data: 1 2 3 6 9 ; get the length (5)
- Count (length / 2) + 1 in this case, the 3rd observation = 3
- What if we add another number?
- 1 2 3 6 9 13
- Count (length /2) from each side and average the two observations that remain
- 3 + 6 = 9
- 9/2 = 4.5
- The median is sensitive to the spread of the data

# The Mode
- The most common value in a dataset

# Measures of spread
- Quantiles, Variance standard deviation

# Quartiles
- Blah

# Standard Deviation and Variance
- When we have multiple observations of data we are interested in how spread apart these values can be
- The 

# Distributions of Data
- Statisticians use the idea of a distribution to summarize how data generated through some process looks
- Think about the difference between a coin flip and a test score
- Both are generated by a stochastic process
- Both may generate the same amount of numbers
- But, we have very different expectations about what values those numbers take in the real world
- A **distribution** describes our expectation not just about the mean of the data (the average value), but also of how spread out it is likely to be

# Session Info

It is good to include the session info, e.g. this document is produced with **knitr** version `r packageVersion('knitr')`. Here is my session info:

print(sessionInfo(), locale=FALSE)
