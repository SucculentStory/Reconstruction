# Introduction
We will review the following statistical concepts here through the lens of R:

- Statistical distributions
- Attributes of distributions
- Samples
- Standard deviations and standard errors
- Statistical models
- Univariate Regression
- Multivariate Regression
- Causality

# Describing Data
- At it's most basic level, statistics is about summarizing and understanding data
- Data are themselves abstractions of real world concepts we care about
- 


# Spread of the Data
- Data spread describes how scattered a data set is
- Consider the two plots below:

```{r varianceplot}
qplot(wt,mpg,data=mtcars)

qplot(mpg,data=mtcars)
qplot(wt,data=mtcars)
```
