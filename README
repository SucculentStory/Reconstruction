# R Tutorial 

These are the materials used for DPI's first annual R bootcamp August 2nd and 3rd 2012 in Madison Wisconsin.

The bootcamp is intended to help non-R users in education policy/research get up to speed on how to use R to do their work, share their results, and collaborate on projects with each other across district and state lines.
