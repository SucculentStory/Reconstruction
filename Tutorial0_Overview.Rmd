# Materials
If you don't have it already, now might be a good time to install R and RStudio to get started. 

- [Download R](http://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/) 
- We'll also want to install a few basic packages. This can be done on the fly later, but a few include `ggplot2`;`knitr`;`plyr`


# Installing R on Windows

# Installation Tips
- Setting up R on Windows XP is straightforward. On Windows 7 or Vista you may need to run in administrator mode to install extensions.
- Standard R interface in Windows is pretty ugly, which is why we use RStudio!

# Next Install packages
First, watch this tutorial<br>

# Install Packages
- Are you running RStudio in administrator mode on Windows Vista or Windows 7?
- If not, you need to be. Right click on RStudio and then click "Run as Administrator"
- If you are on a Mac or Windows XP you can disregard this

# Install Packages (2)
- Now, copy and paste the code below into the bottom left window in RStudio (the R terminal):

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install_new<-function(mypkg){
  if (mypkg %in% installed.packages()) cat("Package already installed")
  else{cat("Package not found, so installing with dependencies... Press CTRL C to abort.")
    Sys.sleep(5)
    install.packages(mypkg,repos="http://cran.wustl.edu/")
}
}

install_new('plyr')
install_new('lmtest')
install_new('ggplot2')
install_new('gridExtra')
install_new('stringr')
install_new('knitr')
install_new('quantreg')
install_new('zoo')
install_new('xtable')
install_new('lme4')
install_new('caret')

```


# Housekeeping
- No food in the Training Center (drinks only with covered lids!)
- Feel free to get up at any time as necessary
- If you get stuck, raise your hand and someone will stop over to look

# Have fun!

Let's get started!
