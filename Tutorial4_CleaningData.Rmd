# Overview
In this lesson we hope to learn:
- The Strategic Data Project
- Checking data for errors
- Recoding data and changing data types
- Diagnostics and error checks

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# set global chunk options
opts_chunk$set(fig.path='figure/slides4-', cache.path='cache/slides4-',fig.width=8,fig.height=6,message=FALSE,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE,autodep=TRUE)
```

# Data Setup
- Let's read in a new dataset now that has some messiness to it

```{r dataread}
load('data/Student_Attributes.rda')
head(stuatt[,1:4],7)
```
- What's wrong with this?

# How can R help correct this?
- Identify problems
- Enforce business rules for messy data consistently
- Build data cleaning into all analyses tasks across the workflow
- Analyze inconsistencies and do reports

# Strategic Data Project
- The Strategic Data Project is

# Toolkit--Data Cleaning
- The SDP has come up with a great tutorial and guided analyses using a great synthetic data set to help walk through the process of cleaning data
- This was written in Stata, we have ported it to R, and are going to walk through just a single lesson of it here (Clean Data Building)

# SDP Task 1 Student Attributes Intro
- Drop the `first_9th_school_year_reported` variable

```{r dropvar9}
stuatt$first_9th_year_reported<-NULL
```
- Later in the tutorial a new variable like this will be created

# SDP Task 1 - Step 1: Consistent Gender
- Is gender unique for each student?

```{r uniquegender}
length(unique(stuatt$sid))
length(unique(stuatt$sid,stuatt$male))
```
- Nah, we have 21,803 unique students in our dataset, but  unique combinations of 21,806 unique combinations of gender and student

```{r uniquenesstest}
testuniqueness<-function(id,group){
  length(unique(id))==length(unique(id,group))
} # Need better varname and some optimization to the speed of this code
testuniqueness(stuatt$sid,stuatt$male)
testuniqueness(stuatt$sid,stuatt$race_ethnicity)
testuniqueness(stuatt$sid,stuatt$birth_date)
```

# Where is the data messy?

```{r seethegenderprob}
stuatt[17:21,1:3]
```
- How do we fix this?

# Unifying Consistent Gender Values
- First we create a variable with the number of unique values gender takes per student
- In R to do this we create a summary table of student attributes by collapsing the data set into one row per student
- Then we ask R to tell us how many rows have what values for the length of gender
```{r collapsegender}
library(plyr)
sturow<-ddply(stuatt,.(sid),summarize,nvals_gender=length(unique(male)))
table(sturow$nvals_gender)
```
- So 4 students have more than one unique value for gender

# Fixing the pesky observations
- At this point there are a number of business rules we could adopt
- We could assign students the most recent value, the most frequent value, or even a random value!
- Let's see if replacing it with the most frequent value works

```{r statmode}
# A function to find the most frequent value
statamode <- function(x) {
  z <- table(as.vector(x))
  m<-names(z)[z == max(z)]
  if(length(m)==1){
    return(m)
  }
  return(".")
}
sturow<-ddply(stuatt,.(sid),summarize,nvals_gender=length(unique(male)),gender_mode=statamode(male),gender_recent=tail(male,1))
head(sturow[7:10,])
```

# Fixing observations II
- Now we have two objects `stuatt` and `sturow` and we need to replace some values from `stuatt` with some values from `sturow`
- `merge` to the rescue!
- Let's `merge` our two data objects into a temporary data object called `tempdf`

```{r reconcilegender}
tempdf<-merge(stuatt,sturow) # R finds the linking variable already
head(tempdf[17:21,c(1,2,3,10,11)])
subset(tempdf[,c(1,2,3,10,11)],sid==12506)
```
- We fixed observation 7, but not observation 12506

# Fixing where the mode does not work
```{r reconcilegender2}
subset(tempdf[,c(1,2,3,10,11,12)],sid==12506)
```
- Our next business rule is to assign the most recent value of gender from the `gender_recent` variable when there is not `gender_mode` that is valid
- This seems like a pretty simple job for `recoding` our variable!

# Recode Gender
- Two step process: first we assign `tempdf$male` to be the same as `tempdf$gender_mode`
- Then, where `tempdf$male` is now a "." indicating no modal category exists, we assign `tempdf$gender_recent` to be `tempdf$male`
- Go ahead and try this and use `testuniqueness(tempdf$id,tempdf$male)` to check if it worked

# Results
```{r solutiongender}
tempdf$male<-tempdf$gender_mode
tempdf$male[tempdf$male=="."]<-tempdf$gender_recent[tempdf$male=="."]
# we have to put the filter on both sides of the assignment operator
testuniqueness(tempdf$id,tempdf$male)
```
- Now let's clean up our workspace, we created a lot of temporary variables that we don't need
```{r cleanup}
rm(sturow)
stuatt<-tempdf
stuatt$nvals_gender<-NULL
stuatt$gender_mode<-NULL
stuatt$gender_recent<-NULL
# or just run stuatt<-tempdf[,1:9]
rm(tempdf)
```

# Create a consistent race and ethnicity indicator
- Let's practice the same procedure on race

```{r raceunique}
testuniqueness(stuatt$id,stuatt$race_ethnicity)
head(stuatt[,1:4])
```

# A Note About Variable Types
- In the SDP Toolkit you are advised to convert the `race_ethnicity` variable to numeric and add labels to it
- This is because Stata and other statistical packages don't have internal data structures that can handle the `factor` variable type like R can, and rely on numeric coding schemes
- Why don't we need to do this in R?
- In fact, in R, we should probably recode the `male` variable as a factor with values `M` and `F`
- One problem is that our datafile uses 'NA' for Native American and we do have to recode that... why?

# Recoding Race
- How do we do this?

```{r recodeerrror,eval=FALSE}
length(stuatt$race_ethnicity[is.na(stuatt$race_ethnicity)])
stuatt$race_ethnicity[is.na(stuatt$race_ethnicity)]<-"AI"
summary(stuatt$race_ethnicity)
```

# Correct conversion
```{r recodenaCORRECT}
length(stuatt$race_ethnicity[is.na(stuatt$race_ethnicity)])
stuatt$race_ethnicity<-as.character(stuatt$race_ethnicity)
stuatt$race_ethnicity[is.na(stuatt$race_ethnicity)]<-"AI"
stuatt$race_ethnicity<-factor(stuatt$race_ethnicity)
summary(stuatt$race_ethnicity)
```
- Factors are pesky, even though they are useful and keep us from having to remember numeric representations of our data

# Inconsistency Within Years
- Let's consider student 3 in our dataset
```{r student3}
stuatt[7:9,c(1,2,4)]
```
- How is this different from our prior problem?
```{r student3u,eval=FALSE}
length(unique(stuatt$sid,stuatt$school_year))
length(unique(stuatt[,c(1,2,4)]))
```


# How should we do the recoding of `stuatt$race_ethnicity`
-

# Answer
```{r racevarcleaning}
tempdf<-ddply(stuatt,.(sid),summarize,var_temp=statamode(race_ethnicity),
              nvals=length(unique(race_ethnicity)),most_recent_year=max(school_year),
              most_recent_var=tail(race_ethnicity,1))
tempdf$race2[tempdf$var_temp!="."]<-tempdf$var_temp[tempdf$var_temp!="."]
tempdf$race2[tempdf$var_temp=="."]<-paste(tempdf$most_recent_var[tempdf$var_temp=="."])
tempdf<-merge(stuatt,tempdf)
head(tempdf[,c(1,2,4,14)],7)
```
- Why do we have to do a paste command?
- What other parts of this code are important to remember?
- Always filter on both sides
- Always use `summarize` in the `ddply` call in this situation

# A Faster Way
- The nice thing about R is we can role processes together once we understand them
- Let's build a script to do this more efficiently

```{r scripting, eval=FALSE}
task1<-function(df,id,year,var){
  require(plyr)
  mdf<-eval(parse(text=paste('ddply(',df,',.(',id,'),summarize,
                             var_temp=statamode(',var,'),
             nvals=length(unique(',var,')),most_recent_year=max(',year,'),
             most_recent_var=tail(',var,',1))',sep="")))
  mdf$var2[mdf$var_temp!="."]<-mdf$var_temp[mdf$var_temp!="."]
  mdf$var2[mdf$var_temp=="."]<-as.character(mdf$most_recent_var[mdf$var_temp=="."])
  ndf<-eval(parse(text=paste('merge(',df,',mdf)',sep="")))
  rm(mdf)
  return(ndf)
}
# Note data must be sorted
tempdf<-task1(stuatt,stuatt$sid,stuatt$school_year,stuatt$race_ethnicity)
```


# Exercises
1. Sort `df` on `measerr` and `mathss`. What are the highest 5 values of each.
