## Some Motivation for Probability

- Probability is around us every day
- Probability underpins phenomena in the world around us everyday
- In fact, the most basic particles of matter are governed by probability
- Probability is literally everywhere

## But what does probability mean?

<p align="center"><img src="img/Doubleslit3Dspectrum.gif" height="300" width="300"></p>

- A probability is quantified statement about how likely something will happen, ranging between 0 (absolutely certain not to happen), and 1 (absolutely certain to happen)
- In practicality, proving a probability of 0 or 1 is quite difficult, except the probability you will enjoy this session!
- Probabilities are inherently tied to the concept of repeatability, a probability represents the proportion of times we expect something to be successful over a reasonable number of trials

## Edward Gibbon

The laws of probability, so true in general, so fallacious in particular.

## Andy Rooney

The 50-50-90 rule: Anytime you have a 50-50 chance of getting something right, there's a 90% probability you'll get it wrong.

## Probability

- $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$
- They make sense
