## Some Motivation for Probability

>- Probability is a mathematical tool to express uncertainty about events in the world 
around us
>- The most basic particles of matter are governed by probability
>- Probability is literally everywhere

## But what does probability mean?

<p align="center"><img src="img/Doubleslit3Dspectrum.gif" height="300" width="300"></p>

- A probability is quantified statement about how likely something will happen, ranging between 0 (absolutely certain not to happen), and 1 (absolutely certain to happen)
- In practicality, proving a probability of 0 or 1 is quite difficult, except the probability you will enjoy this session!
- Probabilities are inherently tied to the concept of repeatability, a probability represents the proportion of times we expect something to be successful over a reasonable number of trials

## Edward Gibbon

The laws of probability, so true in general, so fallacious in particular.

## Andy Rooney

The 50-50-90 rule: Anytime you have a 50-50 chance of getting something right, there's a 90% probability you'll get it wrong.

## Probability
Three simple formulas

- $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ - mutually exclusive A and B
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)$ - not mutually exclusive
- They make sense and we use them everday.
- The first describes independent events -- like the chance two cards drawn from separate decks are the same suit. 
- The second describes mutually exclusive events, such as the chance of drawing **either** a single heart or a spade card from a single deck of cards. 
- The third describes events that are not mutually exlusive. The probability of drawing one card from a deck that is either a heart or a face card or both.

## Meanwhile, in the real world

- We are familiar with these examples from school, but how about the real world?
- Events are not sequenced in the real world, we often have multiple conditions beyond A and B, and we often have different probabilities for different events. We may want to know the probability of event A, given a fixed outcome of probability B.
- We need conditional probability formulas:
- $P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
- When drawing two aces from the same deck, the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is $\frac{4}{52}$, but the probability of drawing a second ace conditional on already drawing an ace is $\frac{\frac{4}{52} * \frac{3}{51}}{\frac{4}{52}}$. Why?

## Real world

- Conditional probabilities are all around us, and are the most interesting to us
- What is the chance a student graduates high school, conditional on having a test score of X?
- What is the chance a student develops an alcohol problem, conditional on having Z type of friends?
- What is the chance a school meets AYP, conditional on receiving additional state and federal aid to improve instruction?
- Probability is often framed alternatively in terms of risk or odds

## Lotteries

- The lottery is one of the most classic cases of a conditional probability
- Let's run our own lottery
- Everyone pick 3 numbers from 1 to 6; and 1 powerball from 1 to 4
- Order does not matter except for the powerball
- Write them down on a piece of paper with your name and hand them in

---

## Exercise

- While I input your picks, think about what your odds of winning are
- Remember, after a number is drawn, it is not replaced so there is a $\frac{1}{6}$ then $\frac{1}{5}$, then $\frac{1}{4}$ choice set for three balls, plus the $\frac{1}{4}$ for the powerball.
- Why or why not do you think the answer you have is correct?

## How do we apply this to our work?

>- What is the probability a student in Wisconsin will graduate from high school?
>- Is this a useful question? 
>- What additional information would help answer the question better? 
>- The list of conditional probabilities is quite large!
>- This is the basis for statistical modeling and statistical analysis
